1. Introduction

      This game is a reborn of this license and gains some new features
       : Multi Player and LAN Games.

2. Synopsis

      2.1. What is R-Type ?

      R-Type is a shoot-em-up with horizontal scrolling. The player 
      commands the R-9A "Arrowhead" to defend mankind against the Bydo 
      Empire. This game was developped by Irem and published by Electric 
      Dreams on Amstrad CPC. The game was released on this support in 
      1987.

      2.2. Main goal of R-Type

      You are a commander lonely onboard the R-9A, your trusty ship. 
      Your mission is to defeat the Bydo Empire, who wants to enslave 
      the humanity. With your trivial equipement, your main goal is to 
      infiltrate the empire and defeat everything that is on your way. 
      To do this, you can have and upgrade your ship with powerful alien
      weapons and fun bonus. You only dispose of 3 lives, so be careful 
      when you encounter the terrible forces of the Bydo Empire.

      2.3. Supported Platforms

      This version of R-Type can be played on UNIX operating systems and 
      Microsoft operating systems. There are the minimum system 
      requirements to install and play the game : 

      Unix : A unix-like operating system with based-packages. You have to
      install the building packages (make and cmake) to be able to compile 
      the sources. Of course, you should install the standard compilers 
      (GCC for C sources and G++ for C++ sources). A standard X server and 
      the Xorg drivers are required to display correctly the game and a 
      standard sound device with Alsa drivers for playing sounds.

      Windows : A Windows operating system is required. You can use all 
      capable systems of Microsoft (minimum Windows 98 Second Edition). 
      You can run the game with all Intel graphics cards, ATI/AMD and 
      nVidia cards. You should have the associated compilers (GCC and G++ 
      for Windows) in order to compile the sources.



R-Type Documentation						[Page 3]


      For the both systems, you have to download and install the last 
      release of SFML (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library) : 2.1. Check 
      the official website (http://www.sfml-dev.org/download-fr.php) or 
      your repository manager for Unix platforms.

3. Installation & Execution

      3.1. How to install on Linux

      First, download the sources of the R-Type. If they are compressed, 
      decompress them with tar or other archive manager. Then, if the
      main libraries (SFML and other) are not installed on your computer
      please install them. Move through the directory and compile the 
      sources with the Makefile (make and cmake). If compilation fails, 
      check the error messages, it possibly means : your operating 
      system isn’t compatible or some libraries are missing.

      3.2. How to install on Windows

      First, download the sources of the R-Type. If they are compressed,
      decompress them with WinZip or other archive manager. Then, if the
      main libraries (SFML and other) are not installed on your computer
      please install them. Launch the installer. If asked, select the 
      directory of the sources and the directory when the binaries will 
      be installed. If installation fails, check the error messages, it 
      possibly means : your operating system isn’t compatible or some 
      libraries are missing.

      3.3. Minimum specifications

      Libraries : SFML 2.1 (older versions are incompatible)
      Standard sound devices and drivers (Alsa for Linux, Realtek or 
      Generic drivers for Windows)
      Standard graphic devices and drivers (nVidia, AMD/ATI, Intel’s 
      chipsets are compatibles)

      NB : You can run the game with a notebook or netbook configuration.
      You don’t need to have a solid configuration to run R-Type, just 
      only the SFML library.

7. Communication Protocol (client / server)


      7.1. Description

      This section describes the behavior of the protocol used to make
      some easy and secure communications between the server and the 
      clients of R-Type.


      7.2. Sending / Receiving procedure

      The communication will match this following procedure : 
      1. First, the server sends data to the connected client(s). This
      data contains three important fields : the player's ID, the sprite
      of the player's ship, the coordinates of the player. This data are
      serialized in UDP form.
      2. Then, the data is converted to a structure that contains these
      informations.
      3. The structure is sent to the concerned client(s) by using UDP
      protocol.
      4. When the client receives that, the data is deserialized and 
      displayed.

      7.3. Errors

      If a packet isn't correct, the client continues to receive data.
      No error message is displayed on the client and the lost data 
      will be re-send by the server.


8. Multi-Player Games


      In R-Type, you can play and compete with other players on the web. 
      The only thing you have to do is to connect your machine to 
      Internet to be able to join a online server. When you are 
      connected, choose the Multiplayer section in the Main Menu and 
      enter the IP address of the server. Then mark the specified port 
      in the appropriated field. Click the Connect button and wait for 
      the status. If succeed, you will be redirected to the Lobby page 
      and if it failed, check the error messages and try to resolve it. 
      For main informations, check the FAQ.

      In the Lobby page, you will be able to join available games or 
      create your own. You can play with 4 players maximum.

      This communication is very simple, but if there is an error during 
      the sending proccess, the packet will be re-send by the client 
      after a certain time. 

      To know your IP adress, open a terminal and type ‘ifconfig’ (Linux)
      or ‘ipconfig’ (Windows) and check the connected devices (Wi-Fi or 
      Ethernet).

9. Frequently Asked Questions (F.A.Q.)


      Q : Why the sources can’t compile on Linux ?
      A : You don’t have the required packages installed on your Linux. 
      Make sure you have installed the standard compilers (GCC, G++, Make
      and CMake). If you have a error with the SFML, make sure you have 
      installed and correctly setted the library on your PC.

      Q : Why the sources can’t compile on Windows during installation ?
      A : On Windows, it’s probably because you don’t have the SFML 
      library installed on your system. You can download the library on 
      the SFML website.

      Q : Why R-Type doesn’t run on Windows ?
      A : R-Type is only compatible with a Microsoft’s operating system 
      that can support the SFML Library. The minimum requirements is to 
      have the Visual C++ 9) on your Windows and the associated 
      compilers (GCC 4.7).

      Q : Why R-Type doesn’t run on Linux ?
      A : R-Type is only compatible on Linux with SFML. You have to 
      install the library on your system. Please check the version of 
      your operating system before installing.

      Q : A error tells that my PC isn’t compatible with the x64 version
      of SFML. How can I resolve it ?
      A : You want to run the game on a x64 platform and your PC is only 
      compatible with x86 versions. In this case, download and install 
      the x86 version of SFML and GCC and re-install the game.

      Q : I can’t connect to a online server. How is it possible ?
      A : You specify a wrong IP adress or you miss to specify the port 
      in order to establish the connection. Please check the good 
      parameters and retry the process. If not, verify your Internet 
      connection.

      Q : Can I play with a controller ? And why it doesn’t work ?
      A : Yes, you can play with a XBOX 360 Controller. If the controller
      doesn’t work, please check if the drivers are correctly installed. 
      And if it is, please check your operating system. You can’t run the
       game and play it with this controller if you are on Linux.
